# Introduction

In this guide we will analyse some of the most commonly used and powerfull machine learning algorithms. We will walk through the intuition behind each algorithm, the required mathematical backround, as well as its implimenation in the R, in a step by step aproach. We will discuss and impliment optimization techniques, explain use cases, meausure their performnce and understand how to interpret and use their outcomes. On top of that, the guide is accompanied by live applications that make use the algorithms to help you understand their value, advantages and drawbacks of various aproaches. This guide does not require any prior knowledge, although some basic mathematical and programming backround whould make things easier. For those that need to occesionally refresh their statistics, there is a chapter devoted to that.

This guide refers to anyone who is intersted in machine learning, from any backroud. We will go far beyon the basics of use cases and implimentation of each algorithm, however at no point will there be anything presented that assumes previous knowledge and is not accompanied by real case examples and implimentations. 

My inspiration for creating this, was the book 'An introduction to Statistical Learning' written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirirani, which I whould highly recomend. It contains labs and exersises for your learning, as well as an aproachable explanation of machine learning algorithms.
