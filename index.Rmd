# Progress {-}

Since this is a living document there are parts that are being edited or still in the process of being written. So far
the completed sections are:

* [2 Linear Regression](linear-regression.html)
* [3 Logistic Regression](logistic-regression.html)
* [4 Advanced Techniques for Linear Algorithms](advanced-techniques-for-linear-algorithms.html)
* [13 Recommendation Systems](recomendation-systems.html)
